# Rust Auto GPT Coder

Rust Auto GPT Coder is an automated agentic code generation tool for web server backend code in Rust.

It is inspired by a course from Packt Publishing: [Craft an AutoGPT Gen AI Instrument with Rust & GPT-4 Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/packt-craft-an-autogpt-code-generation-ai-instrument-leveraging-rust-and-gpt-4).

This implementation largely follows the principles of the course, with a few minor modifications.

 - The model used here is actually OpenAI’s GPT-5.2.
 - The AI functions for the backend developer agent were improved slightly for more robust code output.
 - The project organization was tweaked somewhat for clarity.

# Demo

Here is a demo of `rust-auto-gpt-coder` used to write the backend code for a simple Hangman word game.

And here's a screen recording of some manual API endpoint tests for the auto generated backend code.
